Boilerplate code for a non-portable GNU/Linux demo.

All source code released under the WTFPL.

Improvements in code quality and to further reduce the final
executable size are welcome, contact me or open a merge request.

Featured module in the example: "Bit Loader" by Drozerix (Public
domain). <https://modarchive.org/module.php?178415>

Goals
=====

* Smallest possible executable size (64k target for a full demo)
* "Portable enough" (no fancy dependencies, should run on any typical GNU/Linux desktop: no SDL, no GLFW, no JACK, etc.)

Improvements
============

* ?
